An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all
the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams
of each other.

Here is an implementation of this algorithm in JavaScript:

```js
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) {
    return false;
  }

  const objS = {};
  const objT = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    objS[s[i]] = (objS[s[i]] || 0) + 1;
    objT[t[i]] = (objT[t[i]] || 0) + 1;
  }

  for (let char in objS) {
    if (objS[char] !== objT[char]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

In **isAnagram** function, we first check if the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are equal. If they are not, we return false. Then, we create two empty objects objS and objT to store the objects for s and t, respectively.

We then loop through each character in s and t, and update the object for each character in the corresponding object. We use the || operator to set the initial value of each object to 0 if it does not exist in the object.

Finally, we loop through the keys in objS and check if the value of each key in objS is equal to the value of the corresponding key in objT. If any of these values are not equal, we return false. If all the values are equal, we return true.

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input strings, since we loop through each character in the strings once. The space complexity is also **O(n)**, since we create two objects to store the frequency counters.
