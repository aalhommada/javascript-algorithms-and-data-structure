The Sort the People algorithm is used to sort a given list of people based on their age, height, and gender. Here's how it can be implemented in JavaScript:

Here is a possible solution to the problem in JavaScript:

```js
function sortNamesByHeight(names, heights) {
  const n = names.length;
  const people = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    people.push({ name: names[i], height: heights[i] });
  }
  people.sort((a, b) => b.height - a.height);
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result.push(people[i].name);
  }
  return result;
}
```

The function **sortNamesByHeight** takes two arrays as input: `names` and `heights`, which represent the names and heights of people, respectively. The function creates an array of objects called people, where each object has two properties: name and height, corresponding to the name and height of a person. Then, it sorts the people array in descending order based on the height property using the Array.prototype.sort() method. Finally, the function creates a new array called result with the sorted names and returns it.

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n log n)**, as it uses the sort() method, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is also **O(n)**, as it uses an array of objects called people with a length of n.
