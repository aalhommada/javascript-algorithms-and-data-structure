To solve this problem in JavaScript, you can use the two-pointer approach to modify the array in-place.

- Handle the edge case where the array is empty by returning 0.

- Initialize the variables: count to keep track of the count of unique elements, duplicateCount to keep track of the count of duplicates (initialized as 1 since the first element is unique), and prev to store the value of the previous element.

- Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
  If the current element is equal to the previous element, check if the duplicates count is less than 2. If so, it means we can include the current element as a duplicate. Move the element to the next unique position by assigning it to nums[count], increment count to account for the new unique element, and increment duplicateCount.

- If the current element is different from the previous element, it means we have encountered a new unique element. Move the element to the next unique position by assigning it to nums[count], increment count to account for the new unique element, reset duplicateCount to 1 since the current element is the first occurrence, and update prev to the current element.

- After the loop ends, return the value of count, which represents the count of unique elements in the modified array.

```js
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  // Edge case: If the array is empty, return 0
  if (nums.length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Initialize variables
  let count = 1; // Count of unique elements
  let duplicateCount = 1; // Count of duplicates
  let prev = nums[0]; // Previous element

  // Iterate from the second element onwards
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // If the current element is equal to the previous element
    if (nums[i] === prev) {
      // If duplicates count is less than or equal to 2
      if (duplicateCount < 2) {
        nums[count] = nums[i]; // Move the element to the next unique position
        count++; // Increment count of unique elements
        duplicateCount++; // Increment duplicates count
      }
    }
    // If the current element is different from the previous element
    else {
      nums[count] = nums[i]; // Move the element to the next unique position
      count++; // Increment count of unique elements
      duplicateCount = 1; // Reset duplicates count
      prev = nums[i]; // Update the previous element
    }
  }

  return count; // Return the count of unique elements
}
```

The array nums will be modified in-place, and the first count elements will hold the final result. Any elements beyond the first count elements can have any arbitrary values and are not considered part of the solution.

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array once, comparing each element with the previous element.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are modifying the `nums` array in-place and using a constant amount of extra memory for the variables `count`, `duplicateCount`, and `prev`. We are not allocating any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
