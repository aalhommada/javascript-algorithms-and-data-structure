To solve this problem using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms in JavaScript, we can follow these steps:

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

- Create an array `dp` of length `n`, initialized with maximum possible values except for `dp[0] = 0` since we start at index 0.
- Iterate through the array `nums` from left to right.
- For each index `i`, check if it is reachable from any previous index `j (0 <= j < i)` and update `dp[i]` with the minimum number of jumps required to reach index `i`.
- To update `dp[i]`, compare the current value of `dp[i]` with `dp[j] + 1` and take the minimum.
- Finally, return `dp[n-1]`, which represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.

Here's the JavaScript code for the dynamic programming approach:

```javascript
function minJumps(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const dp = new Array(n).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
  dp[0] = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (j + nums[j] >= i) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[n - 1];
}
```

The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach is **O(n^2)** since we have nested loops iterating through the array.

### Greedy Approach:

- Initialize three variables: `currJump` to store the maximum reachable index from the current position, `maxJump` to store the maximum reachable index so far, and `jumps` to count the minimum number of jumps.
- Iterate through the array `nums` from left to right.
- For each index `i`, update `maxJump` by taking the maximum of `maxJump` and `i + nums[i]`.
- If the current index `i` is equal to `currJump`, it means we have reached the maximum reachable index from the previous jump. So, update `currJump` with `maxJump` and increment `jumps`.
- Continue iterating until `currJump` reaches the last index.
- Finally, return `jumps`, which represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.

Here's the JavaScript code for the greedy approach:

```javascript
function minJumps(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  let currJump = 0;
  let maxJump = 0;
  let jumps = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    maxJump = Math.max(maxJump, i + nums[i]);
    if (i === currJump) {
      currJump = maxJump;
      jumps++;
    }
  }

  return jumps;
}
```

The time complexity of this greedy approach is **O(n)** since we only iterate through the array once.

Both approaches provide a solution to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index. The choice between using dynamic programming or a greedy approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. In this case, the greedy approach offers a more efficient solution.
