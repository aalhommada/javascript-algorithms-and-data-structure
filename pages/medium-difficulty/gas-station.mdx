To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the "circular tour" from the gas station problem. The basic idea is to check if there is a possible starting point that allows us to complete a circular tour without running out of gas.

1. First, we initialize some variables:

   - `totalGas`: This variable keeps track of the total gas available after subtracting the total cost of the journey. We initialize it to 0.
   - `currentGas`: This variable keeps track of the current gas available as we move from one station to the next. We initialize it to 0.
   - `startStation`: This variable stores the index of the potential starting gas station. We initialize it to 0.

2. We iterate through the gas and cost arrays using a loop:

   - For each station, we calculate the difference between the gas available (`gas[i]`) and the cost to travel to the next station (`cost[i]`). This difference represents the net gas gain or loss at that station.
   - We add this difference to both `totalGas` and `currentGas` variables.

3. Inside the loop, we check if `currentGas` becomes negative:

   - If `currentGas` is negative, it means we cannot reach the next station from the current starting station without running out of gas.
   - In this case, we reset `currentGas` to 0 and move the `startStation` to the next station (`startStation = i + 1`).

4. After the loop, we check if `totalGas` is negative:

   - If `totalGas` is negative, it means the total cost of the journey is greater than the total gas available, and hence, we cannot complete the circular tour no matter where we start.
   - In this case, we return -1 to indicate that there is no solution.

5. If we haven't returned -1, it means there exists a solution:
   - We return the `startStation` as the index of the gas station from where we can start the journey and complete the circular tour without running out of gas.

The solution uses a greedy approach by continuously updating the starting station whenever `currentGas` becomes negative. By the end of the loop, if there is a solution, the `startStation` will hold the correct index.

```JavaScript
function canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) {
  const n = gas.length;
  let totalGas = 0;
  let currentGas = 0;
  let startStation = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const diff = gas[i] - cost[i];
    totalGas += diff;
    currentGas += diff;

    // If currentGas is negative, we cannot reach the next station.
    // So, we reset the currentGas and move the startStation to the next station.
    if (currentGas < 0) {
      startStation = i + 1;
      currentGas = 0;
    }
  }

  // If totalGas is negative, it means the total cost is greater than the total gas available,
  // and hence, we cannot complete the circular tour.
  return totalGas < 0 ? -1 : startStation;
}

```

The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the number of gas stations. We iterate through the gas and cost arrays once to calculate the total gas and check for the possible starting station.

The space complexity of the solution is **O(1)** because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the variables totalGas, currentGas, and startStation, regardless of the input size.
