To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to pack words into lines while following the formatting rules. The steps are as follows:

1. Create an empty array to store the lines of text.
2. Iterate through each word in the input array.
3. While iterating, keep track of the current line's characters' count.
4. If adding the next word would exceed the maxWidth, justify the current line and add it to the output array.
5. If the current line is not the last line, calculate the number of spaces needed between words and distribute them evenly.
6. If the current line is the last line, left-justify it, and don't add any extra spaces between words.
7. Continue this process until all words are processed.

Let's implement the solution:

```javascript
function justifyText(words, maxWidth) {
  const lines = [];
  let currentLine = [];
  let currentLineCharCount = 0;

  function addLine(words, maxWidth, isLastLine = false) {
    const numWords = words.length;
    const totalSpaces = maxWidth - currentLineCharCount;
    const totalGaps = numWords - 1;
    const spacesPerGap = isLastLine ? 1 : Math.floor(totalSpaces / totalGaps);
    const extraSpaces = isLastLine ? 0 : totalSpaces % totalGaps;

    let line = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < numWords; i++) {
      line += words[i];
      if (i < numWords - 1) {
        const spacesToAdd = spacesPerGap + (extraSpaces > 0 ? 1 : 0);
        line += " ".repeat(spacesToAdd);
        extraSpaces--;
      }
    }

    if (isLastLine) {
      line += " ".repeat(maxWidth - line.length);
    }

    lines.push(line);
  }

  for (let word of words) {
    if (currentLineCharCount + currentLine.length + word.length <= maxWidth) {
      currentLine.push(word);
      currentLineCharCount += word.length;
    } else {
      addLine(currentLine, maxWidth);
      currentLine = [word];
      currentLineCharCount = word.length;
    }
  }

  addLine(currentLine, maxWidth, true);

  return lines;
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "justification."];
const maxWidth = 16;
const justifiedText = justifyText(words, maxWidth);
console.log(justifiedText);
```

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where `N` is the total number of characters in the input array of words. The algorithm processes each word once and justifies the lines accordingly.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(N)** as well. The space required for the output array of justified lines is proportional to the total number of characters in the input array of words.
